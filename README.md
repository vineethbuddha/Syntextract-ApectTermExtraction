# Aspect Term Extraction

A project to analyse sentiment of aspects (attributes) of entities (objects).

## How to run the notebook?

1. Clone this repo.
2. Head over to https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ and download the "Common Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download)" pre-trained GloVe embeddings and save it in the root folder of this repo (i.e. same folder as the notebook and the data xml files).
3. Install all non-standard python libraries through pip3 and run the notebook cell-by-cell. (Or observe the previously obtained results of each cell.) 

** Note that this experimentation was tested through Python 3.9.7. Results may vary for other versions. **
